This repository stores content that can be used to design a Rapid Threat Model Prototyping (RTMP) process for a software development group.

RTMP is a threat modelling technique that decreases the time to make a threat model while also enabling the process to become more streamlined and effective. The methodology lends itself to automation and inclusion in an Agile or DevOps workflow.
